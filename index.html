                the Bay Area, CA, technology has been an integral</span
              >
              part of my life from an early age. I was always eager and excited
              about the technology all around me, whether it was the family
              computer, gaming consoles, or the latest gadgets. My curiosity led
              me to disassemble and reassemble electronics, trying to understand
              how they worked. These early experiences ignited a passion for
              technology that has only grown stronger over the years. Now, at 21
              years of age, I plan to pursue a career in software development.
              Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various
              programming languages and technologies. I have completed numerous
              projects that have solidified my understanding of software
              development principles and practices.

                Surrounded by the constant evolution of electronics,
              </span>
              I've developed a deep appreciation for the impact of technology on
              our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an associate's degree in
              communications alongside a certificate in computer science, with
              graduation slated for May 2024. Looking ahead, my goal is to
              transfer to a four-year institution to further explore the dynamic
              field of computer science. Eager to expand my skills and gain
              hands-on experience, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities
              for the summer of 2024. I'm excited to embark on new challenges
              and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.
