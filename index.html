               <p>
                Born and raised in the Bay Area, CA, technology has been an integral
                part of my life from an early age. Surrounded by the constant
                evolution of electronics, I've developed a deep appreciation for the
                impact of technology on our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an
                associate's degree in communications alongside a certificate in
                computer science, with graduation slated for May 2024. Looking
                ahead, my goal is to transfer to a four-year institution to further
                explore the dynamic field of computer science. Eager to expand my
                skills and gain hands-on experience, I'm actively seeking internship
                opportunities for the summer of 2024. I'm excited to embark on new
                challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of
                technology.
                <br /><br />
                Outside of academics and technology, I enjoy pursuing various
                hobbies. In my free time, you can often find me taking photos in the
                beautiful Bay Area, experimenting with new coding languages. These
                activities not only offer me relaxation but also inspire creativity
                and foster personal growth.
