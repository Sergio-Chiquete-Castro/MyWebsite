          part of my life from an early age. Surrounded by the constant
          evolution of electronics, I've developed a deep appreciation for the
          impact of technology on our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an
          associate's degree in communications alongside a certificate in
          computer science, with graduation slated for May 2024. Looking ahead,
          my goal is to transfer to a four-year institution to further explore
          the dynamic field of computer science. Eager to expand my skills and
          gain hands-on experience, I'm actively seeking internship
          opportunities for the summer of 2024. I'm excited to embark on new
          challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of
          technology.

            Outside of academics and technology, I enjoy pursuing various
            hobbies.</span
          >
          In my free time, you can often find me taking photos in the beautiful
          Bay Area, experimenting with new coding languages. These activities
          not only offer me relaxation but also inspire creativity and foster
          personal growth.
