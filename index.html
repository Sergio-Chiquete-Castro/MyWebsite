              Bay Area, CA, technology has been an integral</span

            part of my life from an early age. I was always eager and excited
            about the technology all around me, whether it was the family
            computer, gaming consoles, or the latest gadgets. My curiosity led
            me to disassemble and reassemble electronics, trying to understand
            how they worked. These early experiences ignited a passion for
            technology that has only grown stronger over the years. Now, at 21
            years of age, I plan to pursue a career in software development.
            Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in various
            programming languages and technologies. I have completed numerous
            projects that have solidified my understanding of software
            development principles and practices.

              Surrounded by the constant evolution of electronics,
            </span>

            I've developed a deep appreciation for the impact of technology on
            our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an associate's degree in
            communications alongside a certificate in computer science, with
            graduation slated for May 2024. Looking ahead, my goal is to
            transfer to a four-year institution to further explore the dynamic
            field of computer science. Eager to expand my skills and gain
            hands-on experience, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities
            for the summer of 2024. I'm excited to embark on new challenges and
            contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

          Building and coding new things that help improve my everyday life is a
          particular passion of mine. I love creating practical solutions that
          make life easier and more accessible. Photography is another hobby that
          I am deeply passionate about. The beautiful Bay Area provides a
          stunning backdrop for my photography endeavors. Capturing the vibrant
          cityscapes, serene landscapes, and diverse cultures through my lens
          helps me express my creativity Engaging in these activities helps me
          stay motivated, energized, and ready to tackle new challenges both in
          my personal and professional life.
