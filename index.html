          Born and raised in the Bay Area, CA, technology has been an integral
          part of my life from an early age. Surrounded by the constant
          evolution of electronics, I've developed a deep appreciation for the
          impact of technology on our world. Currently, I'm pursuing an
          associate's degree in communications alongside a certificate in
          computer science, with graduation slated for May 2024. Looking ahead,
          my goal is to transfer to a four-year institution to further explore
